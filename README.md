## Project Title
Investigating a Relational Database (Udacity PDSND Project 1)

## Description
A selection of SQL queries created to investigate the [PostgreSQL Sample Database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/). This was Project 1 in my Programming for Data Science Nanodegree from Udacity.

If you'd like to run the queries, you'll need to configure the [dvdrental database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip) on your system.
